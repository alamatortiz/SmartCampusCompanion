## 💻 Git Workflow

Phase 1 Git workflow follows a simple collaborative branching model:

### Main Branch (`main`)
- Contains the stable version of the project
- Only updated with **tested and reviewed code**

### Feature Branches
- Each team member works on the develop and main branch:
- Branches are created from `main` and merged after review

### Pull Requests (PRs)
- Each completed feature branch is merged via pull request
- Team members review code before merging
- Ensures clean integration

### Commits
- Written clearly and descriptively
- Example: `Add CampusInfoScreen with DepartmentCard composable - papagayo`
